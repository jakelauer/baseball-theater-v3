/**
 * The spec-fidelity gate (S29, ADR-016). S27's `oasdiff` gate only compares the
 * spec with its own previous self; this compares it with reality. For every route
 * in the S26 table, the type generated from `openapi/bt-api.v1.json` and the
 * route's `<DomainType>Response` alias — the type actually on the wire — must be
 * mutually assignable. A field the emitter drops, a nullability it loses, a union
 * it widens: each breaks one direction, and `tsc` (in `pnpm build`) fails.
 *
 * Compared against the alias, never the bare domain type, so the ADR-014 DTO
 * adapter stays free to diverge from `GameSnapshot` / `ScheduleDay` later.
