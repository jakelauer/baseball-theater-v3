/**
 * S41's design match (rule 22): the Plays room in the state and pairing of each
 * game-rooms frame it builds — `plays-mobile`, `plays-medium`, `plays-desktop` (the
 * default view: the 9th, its last at-bat open) and `plays-scoring-mobile` (Runs chosen),
 * on the 823823 fixture (CHC @ MIA, Final 6–5).
 *
 * Expected differences, not judged (owner, 2026-10-28: "Judge only the story's own
 * parts"): the frames' sample game (NYY @ BOS, 5–3) versus the fixture game, so names,
 * results, pitch counts, scores and how many at-bats each half has differ; the open
 * at-bat's header carries its matchup, count and description (owner, 2026-10-29: "When
 * expanded, can the accordion header show the data that's in this box"); the catcher's
 * view and its "Animate pitch" / "Side view" / "Top view" links are S64's as the owner
 * reviewed them; the footer's "Fetched … ago" is the real time; the top bar, tabs and
 * rail are S40's and S60's; the linescore is S2's.
