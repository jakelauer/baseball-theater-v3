/**
 * The browser harness (S81; ADR-026 as amended 2026-10-28, backlog rule 22).
 * It runs the app the way `pnpm dev` does — fixture-backed API on :8787 and the
 * Vite app on :5173 — and opens it at the three host pairings. Desktop is
 * 1200px wide, where the app's layout host switches to the rail (owner,
 * 2026-10-28: "Capture at 1200px"), not the frames' 1008px.
 *
 * Not part of `pnpm verify`: browsers start only through `pnpm design:capture`
 * and S62's flows. `BT_E2E_OUTPUT` moves Playwright's own output (traces,
 * failure shots) out of the tree, which graders need (they may not write it).
