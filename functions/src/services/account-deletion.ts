/**
 * Account deletion (ADR-028). Separate from downloading (owner, 2026-10-27:
 * "Deleting and downloading aren't connected"; downloads are
 * `data-downloads.ts`): the deletion accepts only the exact typed phrase and a
 * recent sign-in, then erases the user from every registered store, stored
 * downloads included, and every identity provider at once.
 *
 * The order inside a deletion is what makes a failed attempt retryable with the
 * same session: identity links are read first (the provider accounts need
 * them), the outside providers and other stores go next, `BT database: users`
 * goes last (it holds the links and the account the retry authenticates as),
 * and only after all of that succeeds is the uid logged. Every `deleteFor` is
 * idempotent, so rerunning the steps that already ran is harmless.
