/**
 * MLB Stats API capability drift scanner.
 *
 * S23 built the primitive — `leafPaths` / `uncoveredPaths` in `@bt/mlb-api`
 * compare a raw payload against what its zod parser kept, so a field the schema
 * silently drops is visible. `coverage.test.ts` runs that as a pass/fail gate
 * over the committed corpus.
 *
 * This is the *runnable* form: point it at a directory of raw `fixtures/raw/`
 * payloads (the committed set, or a freshly recorded game) and it reports every
 * unmodeled path per fixture, so a human can triage each into a typed field or
 * a backlog story. It never re-derives the leaf-path diff.
