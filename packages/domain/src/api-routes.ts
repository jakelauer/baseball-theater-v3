/**
 * The typed BT API route contract (ADR-014 "the wire boundary").
 *
 * One runtime-enumerable table maps each route to its response type (and, in
 * `ApiRequestBodies`, the routes that take a body to its type). Both the
 * server's sender (`functions/src/handlers/api.ts`) and the client's fetch
 * helper (`web/src/api/client.ts`) consume this same declaration — a route and
 * its response cannot disagree without breaking a typecheck on one end or the
 * other.
 *
 * Response types are named `<DomainType>Response` aliases (ADR-014 "Response
 * aliases — the DTO seam"), not the bare domain type. Each alias is *derived*
 * (`type XResponse = X`) — structurally identical to its source today, so this
 * is not a second, hand-authored shape and does not reopen the "one type
 * source" drift risk. It plants a named seam: the day an internal-only reason
 * forces a domain field to change while the wire needs to stay stable, that
 * divergence lives in the matching `to<DomainType>Response` mapping function
 * (still a passthrough today), not in a rewrite of the route table.
