## Gap map (doc → story)

| Doc item | Stories |
|----------|---------|
| MLB upstream types + client + fixtures + drift | **S11–S15** (build first) |
| Full-fidelity upstream types (coverage gate) | **S23** (then S13 / S15 reuse the helper) |
| Post-game replay / diffPatch capture | **S22** |
| Ingest → durable BT projections | **S21**, then **S16–S17** |
| ADR-002 live delivery + watched UI (ADR-020 / ADR-021 / ADR-022) | **S43** domain rules → **S46** versions → **S47** graduated caching → **S48** ingest object + cron → **S18** hub object → **S19** watched game → **S20** scoreboard poll |
| Brand theme + cascading color (VISUAL-DESIGN §3) | **S24** (five tokens, `done`), then **S39** (the 2026-10-14 ratified palette — Dark `#10100F`, Raised, Raised current, Primary Light, muted, `pitch/*` roles — **and** the dark-only lock, absorbed from Later themes by the 2026-10-14 review). S39 reddens three `verify-S24.sh` checks on re-run; see the S39 note |
| Visual design per surface + §9 open decisions (VISUAL-DESIGN §5–§9) | **S31** shell + scoreboard (§9: team-color strength, favicon), **S32** game header (incl. ← back) + room chrome + Videos (§9: mobile room chrome, video dialog vs stage), **S33** Live/Box/Recap — Live is the pitch theater (§9: default open at-bat), **S34** Standings/Search/Settings (no §9 row) — owner-approved; gate the UI stories (rule 18) |
| Typed BT API boundary (route → response, both ends) | **S26** (before S25) |
| API versioning + OpenAPI + breaking-change gate (ADR-015) | **S26** (`/api/v1` paths), **S27** (spec + oasdiff), **S28** (sunset / stale client) |
| Spec-fidelity gate (ADR-016) | **S29** (after S27 + S25) — generated response types + mutual-assignability gate, which is ADR-016's stated value ("proof that the spec is faithful") |
| Generated client **DAL** (`openapi-fetch`) (ADR-016) | **S49** (sliced 2026-10-18; before S4 / S5 add routes). Owner 2026-10-14: "No, our own client should use it." |
| Internal API explorer / swagger UI (FEATURES carry, internal-only) | Later themes — no story owns it; S27 put publishing the spec out of scope and ADR-015 lists it as "Still open" |
| Client state / typed read cache (ADR-014) | **S25** (before UI fill and S18–S20) |
| Figma file trails VISUAL-DESIGN (review against FIGMA-EXPLORATION + owner decisions after it) | **S35** shell + scoreboard (R6–R9, R14a, R16, R17a, R18), **S36** game header + tab bar + Videos + player (R6, R7, R10, R14b, R15, R18), **S37** Live/Box/Recap (R6–R8, R11, R12, R18), **S38** Standings/Search/Settings (R13, R17b, R18) — each feeds S31–S34. **R1–R5** were minor design fixes already made in the Figma file (owner, 2026-10-08) — no revision item. |
| Ratified design with **no build story** (2026-10-14 review; all owned by the 2026-10-19 design intake) | ← back top bar, phase-aware tabs, room states → **S40**; boxed linescore + Game info → **S2**; Plays → **S41**; (a) Live pitch theater body → **S63** data + **S64**; (b) Videos room → **S69** + player **S70**; (c) scoreboard → **S65**–**S68**, digest **S71**; (d) Settings controls → each with its reader (**S6** favorites + Opens First, **S67** slot, **S68** collapse + Hide Scores, **S70** Video Player); (e) shell, favicon, rail `Active`, drawer → **S60**. Undrawn results and owner decisions the frames contradict → design **S56**; Hide Scores beyond the scoreboard → design **S57**. Win probability: left out at launch (owner, 2026-10-19) |
| FEATURES carry rows with **no build story** (2026-10-09 parity review; owned 2026-10-19) | **Hide scores** → **S68** scoreboard, **S75** rooms and recap title (+ design **S57**); **playback prefs** → **S70**; game-row slot / collapse → **S67** / **S68**; **highlight search by date + tag** → **S72**; **settings sync** → free for every signed-in user (**S6**, ADR-027). Still unowned: **Savant deep links** (Pro Backer gate), **Patreon link + server-enforced entitlements** (Later themes) |
| Scoreboard → game loop UI | **S60** shell → **S61** team colors → S2, S3, S41, S10 → **S63**/**S64** Live → **S65**–**S68** scoreboard → **S69**/**S70** Videos → **S71** digest → S18/S19 live push → S20 |
| Standings | S4 (after S13 + S21; prefer S24; gated on **S34**) |
| Search | S5 (prefer S24; typographic results; gated on **S34**) |
| Settings | S6 (no presentation-profile layer; gated on **S34**) |
| Platform (ADR-017): off Firebase, onto Workers | **S42** remove Firebase → **S44** Fetch handlers + route table → **S45** Worker entry + local Workers runtime; deploy pipeline is a Later theme (owner go-ahead) |
| BT-backed data / ports (ADR-018) | **S46** ports + shared contract → **S50** Postgres adapter → **S51** `pnpm dev` on Postgres in Docker. S7 and S9 are `superseded` |
| Auth G3 (ADR-019) | **S8** identity ports + BT session (no passkeys at launch) → Logto adapter + sign-in UI (Later theme; needs a design story) → Patreon link (Later theme) |
| Plays / pitch viz | Pitch theater is **Live** (S3 status row; the rest is the *Live pitch theater body* row above). Plays is the ratified inning-sidebar room with at-bat accordions and a whole-game scoring-plays view → **S41** (inserted 2026-10-14), after S2's boxed linescore |
| Sign-in / account UI (VISUAL-DESIGN §6 Settings & auth) | Design **S58** (code-first email, no passkeys); web session + dev sign-in **S59**; Logto adapter + sign-in screens remain a Later theme after S58 |
| VISUAL-DESIGN later (AppShell rail chrome in code, §9 no-spoilers for free-text titles — decided by **S57**, built by **S75**; FEATURES records it at the next parity review) | Later themes — team-color strength and favicon belong to **S31**; host pairings are already **Accepted** (mobile / medium / desktop) |
| AI / multi-source / Web Push | Later themes (ADR-022 dedupe records noted there) |
| Web client platform (ADR-023 SPA + PWA) | Design **S55** → **S73** installable app → **S74** offline reading; S28's upgrade prompt shares S73's notice |
| Client state (ADR-024) + account settings (ADR-027) | **S8** → **S59** → **S6** (one Zustand store hydrated from the account) |
| Code quality (ADR-025) | **S52** derivations + lint, **S53** `jscpd` + comment check + reuse-check rule; duplication sweep in every backlog review |
| Budgets + coverage (ADR-026) | **S54** size + render counts + ratchet, **S62** Lighthouse CI + Playwright |
