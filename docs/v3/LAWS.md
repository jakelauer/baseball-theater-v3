# Laws

What must stay true on every commit, whoever changes the code — and, beside it, every check every story's grader makes, sorted into the two kinds (S84).

The owner, 2026-10-28: *"Any given story may perform work whose requirements are specific to that story's functionality, but another story might do work that directly conflicts. … We'd only want to check each test's outcomes within the scope of its work, not in the context of the entire system."* And: *"The first would be an "at commit time" check which essentially proves the work is complete as defined at the time it's built, and would only be expected to succeed against the codebase as of the time of its commit. The second would be more of a law, something that defines things which ought to be checked henceforth."*

- **A grader is a commit-time proof.** `scripts/verify-<ID>.sh` proves its own story as the code stood when the story shipped. Its "this story didn't change X" checks look only at the story's own commits (`story_diff` / `story_changed_files` in `scripts/lib/checks.sh`), and `scripts/audit.sh story <ID> --reverify` runs it in a worktree at the story's shipping commit. A later story may legitimately do what an earlier grader forbade; the earlier grader stays true.
- **A law runs in `pnpm verify` on every commit** and is listed below with where it is enforced. Adding, changing or removing a law is an owner decision, recorded like a budget change (ADR-026). A requirement a story wants to hold forever becomes a law here, not a check in its grader.
- **Proposed** laws are requirements that should hold forever but that nothing in `pnpm verify` checks yet. Each names what would enforce it; a later story builds that, one law at a time.

`scripts/backlog-vault/laws.test.ts` fails when an enforced law's file is missing or its step is not in the `pnpm verify` chain.

## The laws

| ID | Law | Source | Enforced by | Step | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| L1 | Browser storage is touched only in `web/src/storage/` (`bt/no-browser-storage`) | ADR-028 (S76) | `tools/eslint-rules/no-browser-storage.js` | lint | enforced |
| L2 | No arithmetic or `Math.*` over BT data in web components and pages (`bt/no-domain-arithmetic`) | ADR-025 rule 1 (S52) | `tools/eslint-rules/no-domain-arithmetic.js` | lint | enforced |
| L3 | Every repository class, `UserProfile` field and adapter directory is labeled in the personal-data manifest | ADR-028 (S76) | `functions/src/services/data-classification.test.ts` | test:coverage | enforced |
| L4 | The API's dispatched routes equal `ApiRoutes` | ADR-017 (S44) | `functions/src/handlers/route-table.test.ts` | test:coverage | enforced |
| L5 | The entry JavaScript stays within 200 KB gzipped (`pnpm size`) | ADR-026 (S54) | `.size-limit.json` | size | enforced |
| L6 | Every package meets its coverage floor | ADR-026, backlog rule 21 (S54) | `web/vitest.config.ts` | test:coverage | enforced |
| L7 | No copy-paste above the threshold (`pnpm dup:check`) | ADR-025 (S53) | `.jscpd.json` | dup:check | enforced |
| L8 | Every unfinished UI story carries a **Design match (rule 22)** criterion | ADR-026 as amended 2026-10-28, rule 22 (S81) | `scripts/backlog-vault/parse.ts` | lint | enforced |
| L9 | The backlog notes and `BACKLOG.md` agree; a UI story waits for its ratified design; every story says what it is for | backlog rules 5, 18, 19 (V3) | `scripts/backlog-vault/cli.ts` | lint | enforced |
| L10 | The generated web API types match the published spec | ADR-016 (S29) | `web/src/api/codegen.test.ts` | test:coverage | enforced |
| L11 | No explicit `any` | CLAUDE.md "TypeScript strict" (S11, S13, S25, S29); typescript-eslint recommended | `eslint.config.js` | lint | enforced |
| P1 | Only `web/src/layout/` reads the viewport (`useMediaQuery`, `hiddenFrom`, `visibleFrom`; `bt/no-viewport-outside-layout`) | ADR-014 rule 8 (S6, S40, S59, S60, S83); owner, 2026-10-28: *"Yes: P1, P3, P5, P8"* (S85) | `tools/eslint-rules/no-viewport-outside-layout.js` | lint | enforced |
| P3 | The web app never calls MLB directly (`bt/no-mlb-in-web`) | ADR-002 (S16); owner, 2026-10-28 (S85) | `tools/eslint-rules/no-mlb-in-web.js` | lint | enforced |
| P5 | No personal data (emails, exports) in logs (`bt/no-personal-data-in-logs`) | ADR-028 (S77, S80); owner, 2026-10-28 (S85) | `tools/eslint-rules/no-personal-data-in-logs.js` | lint | enforced |
| P6 | Coverage floors never fall — except where an active override in [Overrides](#overrides) covers it | backlog rule 21 (owner, 2026-10-19: ratchet) (S7, S25, S29, S42–S44, S49, S52, S54) | would be: a test comparing each floor with its last committed value | — | proposed |
| P7 | Sealed design files never change — except where an active override in [Overrides](#overrides) covers it | backlog rule 18 (S55–S58, S78) | would be: a test verifying every `RATIFIED.md` and amendment manifest | — | proposed |
| P8 | `pnpm verify` starts no browser | S81; owner, 2026-10-28 (S85) | `scripts/backlog-vault/verify-chain.test.ts` | test:coverage | enforced |
| P9 | No breaking API change without a new version — except where an active override in [Overrides](#overrides) covers it | ADR-015, ADR-016 (S27, S44) | `pnpm api:breaking` runs in CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`), not in `pnpm verify` | — | proposed |

**Owner decisions, 2026-10-28.** P1, P3, P5 and P8 are enforced (*"Yes: P1, P3, P5, P8"*; built by S85). Taken out of the registry: no team-logo images and no magic-link or passkey sign-in (*"Some of these aren't wrong, but don't need to be checked or can't be checked: P2, P4"*) — the graders that checked them still prove their own stories; and the cookie law (*"One was just an example: P10 (not saying it's not a good idea, but it should be a consequence of a conscious choice, not an example)"*) — it is added when a story deliberately introduces cookies. P6, P7 and P9 hold *"except when directed by the owner to override, with a reason and explanation, and a clear scope, so the override is not indefinite"*; for P9: *"Specifically for P9, my fear was having to make a "breaking change" that actually removes a breaking change, i.e. a change that is considered breaking compared to the prior version, but that prior version is broken and there is some reason why avoiding versioning matters."*

## Overrides

A law marked *except where an active override covers it* yields only to a row here, written at the owner's direction (owner, 2026-10-28: *"except when directed by the owner to override, with a reason and explanation, and a clear scope, so the override is not indefinite"*). Each row quotes the owner, says why, names exactly what it covers (the floor, the file, the route and spec version — never "everything"), and says when it ends (a story ID, a date, or the event that retires it). When a story enforces such a law, its check reads this table and allows only what an active row covers; an ended row allows nothing. No row is ever deleted — ended rows stay as the record.

| Law | Owner's words | Why | Scope | Ends | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Every grader, sorted

Each declared check of each `scripts/verify-*.sh`, as **pinned** (proves its own story at its commit) or **law** (should hold forever: `enforced:` names the law that holds it in `pnpm verify`, `proposed:` the law that would). A law row stays in its grader too — a grader still proves its story did the thing — but holding it from now on is the law's job.

## Graders edited after their story shipped

The owner, 2026-10-28: *"some of the graders were modified after the original commit of the story, and I want to either reverse those changes to match the pattern as if it had existed already OR record something that notes why we did NOT change them despite the updated system."* Commits after each story's completion entry (a backfill's `Shipped in` commit); a story's own checkpoints don't count.

| Grader | Commits | Decision | Why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| S11 | `a854c28` | kept: per-check reporting retrofit | S13 moved every grader onto `scripts/lib/checks.sh` when the ledger began: each check is now declared and reported; what it checks is unchanged. A grader written under the pinned model would have had this form. |
| S12 | `a854c28` | kept: per-check reporting retrofit | As S11. |
| S21 | `a854c28` | kept: per-check reporting retrofit | As S11. |
| S14 | `707b595` | kept: wording only | "seam" became "recording path" in check names and comments (the owner's terminology); the checks test the same code and pass 6/6 at S14's shipping commit. |
| S15 | `d0f1950` | kept: the pinned model, early | Its `.github/` fence check was pinned to S15's own commit — the pattern this story makes standard. |
| S22 | `d0f1950`, `21e99c5` | kept: the pinned model, early; a bug fix | `d0f1950` pinned its `web/` fence check to S22's own commit; `21e99c5` fixed a false match in finding the reconstruction test, without changing what is proven. |
| S23 | `e2c6feb`, `a854c28` | restored | `e2c6feb` (S22's commit) loosened checks 3 and 7 so S23's grader would accept S22's later work (two more JSON-node types; S23 no longer asserting it leaves `diffpatch-823823.json` to S22). Reverted: S23's grader again proves S23 at its shipping commit, where it passes 10/10. `a854c28` kept (reporting retrofit, as S11). |
| S55 | `7e2818c` | kept: the pinned model, early | Scoped to S55's own amendment and manifest so later amendments in the same folder don't count — the pattern this story makes standard. |
| V3 | `5036023`, `f74767c`, `9ea8507`, `d0f1950` | restored | `f74767c` loosened check 5 so later backlog growth (new stories, re-numbered priorities) wouldn't turn it red, and `9ea8507` widened check 7 to a renamed pre-commit step; both reverted, and check 5 now reads `BACKLOG.md` at V3's own commit (`story_tip`). Kept: `5036023` (a pipefail flake fix) and `d0f1950` (expects S22 to pass once S22 was pinned). V3 passes 10/10 at its shipping commit. |
| S6, S27, S59, S60, S77, S80, S83, V1, V2 | this story (S84) | restored | Each compared a fixed base with whatever tree it ran in; now each compares the story's own commits (`story_diff` / `story_changed_files`). V3's check 4 likewise. |

## Re-verified at shipping commits

Each grader as it stands today, run by `scripts/reverify-all.sh` in a worktree at its story's shipping commit (S84 AC 7).
