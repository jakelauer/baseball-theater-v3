#   pnpm parity:debt          # prints why or why not; exit 1 when due, 0 when not
#
# Measured from the commit that logged the newest "doc parity review" entry, or the
# owner's answers to one, in docs/v3/AUDIT.md. A parity review commits its edits
# together with that entry, and applying the owner's answers is logged the same way
# (scripts/audit.sh answers parity), so neither counts as debt.
# Due when, since then: a product doc changed, a story note was added or removed, a
# story's **Source:** line changed, a pillar-cited story's purpose changed (its Gap,
# Impact or acceptance criteria — the owner's approval may no longer cover it), or 6
# stories went `done` (doubled from 3 by the owner, 2026-10-21). Other story-text edits
# don't count: a feature citation is checked against FEATURES, not the story text, and a
# pillar story's scope list, goal-line paths, work items or notes don't change what it is
# for (owner, 2026-10-23: narrowed after scope-list edits alone kept making it due).
#
# Reads committed history only (HEAD); uncommitted edits are not counted.
