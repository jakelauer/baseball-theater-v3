# drift: the debt checks measure from the answers entry, as from the review.
#
# Flags: --commit <sha> names the shipping commit; --no-verify skips the repo-wide
# pnpm verify for entries covered by another run; --findings - reads stdin.
# --design-match <verdict|-> (rule 22, S81) pairs each capture in
# docs/v3/design-checks/<ID>/ with its ratified frame under docs/v3/visual/,
# recording both SHA-256s and the owner's verdict, quoted. A story whose note has a
# `design:` list cannot be recorded as completed without it (backlog rule 22).
# `design <ID>` records such a verdict on its own, without running the grader (S84).
# --reverify runs today's grader in a temporary worktree at the story's shipping commit
# (scripts/lib/reverify.sh): a grader proves its own story, not the repo at HEAD (S84).
#
# Unlike a grader this DOES write to the working tree — that is its whole job.
# It never fabricates results: every check line in a story entry comes from a
# real grader run captured here. A story is not done until its ledger entry is
# committed alongside the code.
#
# Prints a commit-message summary block to stdout on completion.
