# The sibling of scripts/parity-debt.sh. Measured from the commit that logged the
# newest "backlog review" entry, or the owner's answers to one, in docs/v3/AUDIT.md
# (a design intake logs as a backlog review, so it moves the same base).
#
# Detects the drift events that leave a trace in committed history:
#   - a surface ratified or a ratified amendment landed     → design intake review
#   - ARCHITECTURE.md changed (an ADR accepted or changed)  → design intake if the diff
#     names a frontend ADR (003, 008, 014, 016, 020–026), else backlog review
#   - a new workspace package appeared
#   - a story note added or removed, or a story's priority changed (inserted or
#     re-prioritized outside a review)
#   - a story's acceptance criteria rewritten
#   - the `verify` script in package.json changed (the gate moved)
#   - 6 stories went `done` (doubled from 3 by the owner, 2026-10-21)
# Not detectable here, so still the agent's to notice: a scope fence widened or a
# turn cap hit mid-run (rule 10 stop-and-report).
#
# Reads committed history only (HEAD); uncommitted edits are not counted.
